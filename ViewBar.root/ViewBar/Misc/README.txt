1. What is AGLOCO all about?
AGLOCO is the first Internet based economic network, which enables you as a
 Member to ¡®Get your share of the internet.¡¯ Advertisers, search companies, 
 online merchants and other businesses currently pay lots of companies to 
 deliver people like you to them to get your attention and sell goods. With
 AGLOCO they will be paying YOU.

AGLOCO is also a global community of Internet users whose active Members can 
be paid for all their online activity. By downloading our proprietary Viewbar 
technology, members benefit from engaging yet unobtrusive content tailored to
 their interests. AGLOCO also pays its members to refer their friends to the
 community (and for those friends to refer more friends through four levels 
 of extended referrals.) 


2. How do I earn cash and shares?
Sign up, use the web as usual and earn cash and shares - it really is that 
simple. Once you install the Viewbar software it automatically records the time 
you're actively online, and we pay you for it. But the first step is to sign up
 and become a member. It's fast and it's free. If you refer your friends and 
 family we'll pay you even more cash and shares. Visit our Referral Center for 
 helpful tips.



3. How do referrals work?
AGLOCO pays you an hourly rate when the friends and family you recruit 
(called ¡°direct referrals¡±) use the web with the Viewbar running, as well as for 
people your referrals recruit (called ¡°extended referrals¡±). Extended referrals 
continue for four levels past your original referral, and there is no limit to the
 number of referrals you can accumulate. Check out our Referral Page for more 
 information.



4. Are there rules or restrictions?
There are some rules, and all are intended for the benefit of AGLOCO members:

    * Sign Up Only Once: Each person can only sign up once, creating an account for 
	him or herself, and may not establish an account on behalf of anyone else. 
	Accounts cannot be transferred between people, and each account must be for a 
	physical person.
    * No spamming: AGLOCO strictly forbids spamming to get referrals. This means 
	you can only tell people you know or who explicitly agree to receive your 
	invitation to be referred. If you use spam to try to get referrals, your account
	will be terminated. For more information, see our Anti-Spam Policy
    * Number of Internet Hours: The maximum number of payable hours per month is
	currently 5. Over time, depending on several variables that number may change
	at AGLOCO ¡¯s discretion. The reason we implemented this limit is to prevent 
	hacking software from continuously clicking and thereby generating online search.
	Remember you can still increase your profits by referring more people to AGLOCO.
    * Active Surfing: You have to actively surf to earn cash for your online usage.
	Just keeping a website up does not constitute active surfing. If you use a software
	piracy device that constantly clicks through websites, AGLOCO ¡¯s anti-hacking 
	instruments will detect and ¨C after investigation ¨C disconnect your account.
	In addition, you have to be an active online Member in order to get the benefit 
	of your referrals' surfing. If you surf only 50% of the maximum payable hours 
	a month, and your referrals each surf 100%, you will be credited with only 50% 
	of the payable surfing time for each referral. See our Global Payments Table for
	details of payable hours by country.
    * Accuracy of Information: All information submitted during signup must be 
	accurate; members who deal with AGLOCO in a fraudulent fashion will forfeit 
	their memberships, their account balance, and their referrals. You will have
	to accept these terms before signing up and being able to download the Viewbare.
	See our Membership Agreement for more information. 





5. Do I need to buy anything?
No, AGLOCO Membership is absolutely free. You will never have to buy or sell anything.
 Simply sign up, download your free copy of the Viewbar software, refer your friends 
 and family, and get your share of the Internet!



6. Why is AGLOCO giving 100% of its stock to its Members?
We believe the internet should be a platform for users to benefit from, and if anyone 
generates money from users¡¯ normal online activities, it should be the users themselves.
 Distribution from the company



7. How will you (the Development Team) make money if all the AGLOCO shares are given
 to Members?
AGLOCO pays a 10% fee to its management company, much like Tom Cruise has an agent that 
he pays 10%. In order to make and keep AGLOCO a vibrant community it needs to attract 
the best management it can. Since no stock is given to managers or founders (only Members 
are issued stock). This fee serves as an incentive to attract the best talent to help 
run AGLOCO.



8. What is AGLOCO ¡¯s Privacy Policy?
AGLOCO is totally committed to your privacy. We do not sell, rent or give away your 
personally identifiable personal information to any marketer or advertiser. We have a 
detailed Privacy Policy which explains in plain language how we protect your privacy. 
Read our Privacy Policy ?



9. What will my shares be worth?
As a profit-seeking venture, the value of the shares will be directly related to the 
value of the company. Since AGLOCO ¡¯s profitability is dependent upon its Members¡¯ internet 
usage, the greater the number of AGLOCO Members the more the shares will be worth. We 
are currently in the process of listing the company on the London Stock Exchange (AIM). 
As with any public company, the market will decide what is the fair value of the share.
